# face-recognition-based-attendance
hllo dear, welcome to this face reccognition based attendance project .As i am not very familiar with github but i will try to
give you a  good demonstartion of this project with this file. 
used s/w and packages are as follows:
 i have used python language for this project. 
 i have used opencv package of python for training and recognizing process.
 i have used mysql database with python for maintaining the attendance .
 i have used LBPHFacerecognition algorithm for recognition.
When you will go through the code , you will get that a dataset folder with face samples is required and you can 
make it with dataset.py file.
For training the algorithm , we need to analyze that dataset folder and you can do it with trainer.py file.
When you will run trainer.py file , it will create a new .xml file which we will read for recognizing the faces.
Finally we need to run the main.py file which will capture the photo and recognize the faces.
Make sure that your database should have that table aand field name with required format.
  At last , i hope you have get some idea about the project and you can perform this project with a little more knowledge.
  Now , you are ready to go through the code and try to perform this with your preferred format.
  Good Luck!
